# Final Project for CS 211 at Northwestern University

Wordplay application inspired by Wordle where the user has a limited number of guesses to determine a randomly chosen five letter word. The tiles would light up different colors (green, grey, yellow) depending on the correctness of each letter in the user's guess. Built using ge211 (https://tov.github.io/ge211/), a game engine in C++.
